## In the specific case of the AHC vineyard, we have some constraints:

1) these vines are not harvested mechanically, so the technician chosing berries for the sample has the freedom to reject a "randomly targeted" cluster based on the likelihood that the cluster will actually be harvested. (Many clusters experience excessive mildew, raisening, and/or bird damage.)

2) bird netting panels partially obstruct the sampling activity, awkward to physically reach certain clusters and/or portions of a cluster.

3) the trial involves progressive sampling in August at 2 week intervals. This means that some berries are significantly larger than others.

4) the program director prefers that cluster sampling NOT be used. 


## Sampling Methodology

1) attempt to collect two berries from each side of the main trunk. Sizewise, they should fall on either side of the estimated mean berry size.

2) each berry should be from a different cluster. attempt to choose one berry from each side of the row.

3) choose clusters that will likely be harvested, avoiding damaged clusters.

4) imagining a gaussian distribution of berry size for a given cluster, choose a berry that lies within 2 standard deviations of the average. (Do not choose the largest or the smallest from an individual cluster.)

5) given that Chardonnay clusters are tight in the middle, choose berries that are easily detached from the top or bottom of the cluster. Avoid breaking berries.

6) collect 100 berries from one row, stopping to turn around and reverse course, collecting the next 100 berries from the adjacent row.

7) for the next collection activity (two weeks later), begin the process at the other end of the row.
